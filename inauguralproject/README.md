# Inaugural project

The **results** of the project can be seen from running [inauguralproject.ipynb](inauguralproject.ipynb).

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires no further packages.

**Introduction**
This project examines couples use of time between hours working in the market and at home to maximize their joint utility.

In the first two questions we assume the choice set is discrete in half hours. We illustrate how $\frac{H_F}{H_M}$ changes with different values of elasticity of substitution and productivity in home production for females relative to males. We also plot $\log\frac{H_F}{H_M}$ against $\log\frac{w_F}{w_M}$ for different values of $w_F$. 

In the third question we plot $\log\frac{H_F}{H_M}$ against $\log\frac{w_F}{w_M}$ for different values of $w_F$ again, but this time the choice set is continuous.

In the last two questions we run different regressions. First to find values of elasticity of substitution and productivity in home production for females relative to males that minimizes $(\beta_0+ beta_0^\hat)^2+(\beta_1+ beta_1^\hat)^2$. Afterwards we try to implement an extension of the model.

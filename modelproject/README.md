# Model analysis project

Our project is titled **The Solow model with land** and is about investigating an extension of the basic Solow model. We find the steady state analytically and numerically. Afterwards, we make a Solow-diagram and find the golden rule saving rate. 

The **results** of the project can be seen from running [modelproject.ipynb](modelproject.ipynb).

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires no further packages.

# Data analysis project

Our project is titled **Corona's influence on young women's unemployment** and is about how the number of positive corona cases influence unemployment for young women between the age of 15-24 in 22 the EU countries that are also OECD members. We investigate this for the time period 2019Q3 to 2021Q3 with descriptive plot and fixed effect estimation.

The **results** of the project can be seen from running [dataproject.ipynb](dataproject.ipynb).

We apply the **following dataset**:

Note: This dataset has been used in a previous project.

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires the following installations:

``pip install matplotlib-venn``
``pip install geopandas ``
``conda install -c pyviz geoviews ``

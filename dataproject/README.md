# Data analysis project

Our project is titled **Corona's influence on young women's unemployment** and is about how the number of positive corona cases influence unemployment for young women between the age of 15-24 in 22 the EU countries that are also OECD members. We specifically work with the second quarter of 2021.

The **results** of the project can be seen from running [dataproject.ipynb](dataproject.ipynb).

We apply the **following dataset**:

1. data.xlsx (*source*)

Note: The data is from https://data.worldbank.org and https://ourworldindata.org and is a dataset used in a previous project.

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires the following installations:

``pip install matplotlib-venn``
